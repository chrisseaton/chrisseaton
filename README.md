I'm a Researcher (Senior Staff Engineer) at [Shopify](https://shopify.engineering/), where I work on the Ruby programming Language, and a Visitor at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/).

I was formerly a Research Manager at the [Oracle Labs](https://labs.oracle.com/) Virtual Machine Research Group, where I led the [TruffleRuby](https://chrisseaton.com/truffleruby/) implementation of Ruby, and worked on other language and virtual machine projects. Before this I [completed a PhD](https://chrisseaton.com/phd/) at Manchester where I researched programming languages and irregular parallelism, and an MEng at the University of Bristol on languages with [mutable syntax and semantics](https://chrisseaton.com/katahdin/).

In my spare time I'm Squadron Leader of the [Cheshire Yeomanry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire_Yeomanry) squadron of the Queen's Own Yeomanry, Cheshire's historic reserve [light cavalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cavalry) squadron.
